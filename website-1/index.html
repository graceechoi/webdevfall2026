                        <p>This was the era when I just listened to whatever was playing on the TV or in the car. I had songs that I liked more than the others, but I didn't call them my favorite songs. I was heavily influenced by my parents and what CDs we had, but as I grew up, they let me pick out new CDs to borrow from the library. This was when I started listening to Kidz Bop... not sure why but my mom really liked it too for some reason. It was my main exposure to the biggest hits in pop music in the 2010s, and it remains very nostalgic to hear the original songs now.

                        <p>Another genre of songs that my parents already had as CDs were classical/jazz music, and because I was learning to play the piano and violin, I enjoyed listening to those in the car as well.</p>

                        <p>My family also had the radio on often, playing K-Love, a Christian music channel. We still have it playing in our cars today, so its been part of my music life since then.</p>

                        <p>Throughout this era, I still didn't really listen to music on my own. I got exposure to original pop songs (not Kidz Bop!!) through random radio channels in the car. My first exposure to KPop was through various Korean variety shows that my family would watch together, where singers would come out and sing or their songs would play in the background. But at the time, I wasn't too interested in listening to them on my own.</p>
                        <p>Towards the end of my middle school era though, I finally started wanting to listen to music, primarily to entertain myself while doing homework. The problem was that I didn't have anything to listen to, and it felt awkward to me. Looking back now, I can't believe I didn't listen to music at all while doing things.

                        <p>December 2018 was when I finally fell into KPop with BTS. At the time, my interest was slowly growing in them because they were becoming popular, and I was also looking for music to listen to. The day I fell for them was when my friend showed me their music videos, and one member caught my eye. Ever since then, I started searching them up and watching every single YouTube video about them. Before then, I never thought I would like KPop, so this was a big turning point in my life.</p>
                        <p>My whole high school era was consumed by KPop, with me liking Seventeen next, and then continuing to discover more groups. When I started liking ("stanning") a new group, I would be really obsessed with them for a while, so I tried to limit myself... but that didn't really happen. Most of the groups I stanned were older groups (3rd generation) that already had a lot of songs and content, so I had a lot to catch up on. I also only listened to the songs of groups I liked and wasn't interested in exploring outside of them.</p>

                        <p>Now in college, I listen to music all the time, like when I walk to classes, when I'm studying, when I do the dishes, etc. I don't know what I would do without music now, which is crazy to think about. Now the problem is that I don't have enough songs that I like to listen to.</p>
                        <p>I still go through those phases of stanning a new group and obsessing over them, but now it's multiple groups at once and less obsessive. I like more newly debuted groups now, but the older groups are still fond to me. I also only listened to boy groups but now I listen to girl groups too. Though I'm still not really into non-KPop songs, I expanded a little  with Korean bands. Because I'm always on the search for music to listen to, I explore more outside of my favorites. I'm updated on newly released KPop songs to see if I like it, no matter if I stan them or not. If I like a song from a group I don't stan, I still add it to my playlist, which I used to not do.</p>
